# Contributing to ReTune.AI

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ReTune.AI as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Development Setup

1. Clone your fork of the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see README.md)
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style and naming conventions
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Bug Reports

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We love feature suggestions! Please provide:

- A clear and descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed feature
- Explain why this feature would be useful
- Consider including mockups or examples
